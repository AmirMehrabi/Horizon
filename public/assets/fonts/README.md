# Pelak Font Files

Please add the following Pelak font files to this directory:

- `pelak.woff2` (primary format, best compression)
- `pelak.woff` (fallback format)

You can obtain Pelak font from:
- Official source: https://fontiran.com/fonts/pelak
- Or use any other Persian font that supports the required character set

**Note:** The current implementation will fall back to Vazirmatn and system fonts if Pelak is not available.
